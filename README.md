# Capstone-Task5-Level-2

This project was a **Capstone** project I did in my **Hyperion Development** Bootcamp. The task was to create an Ecommerce store using **bootstrap** as our
CSS library and **vanilla Javascript** for creating the page logic. This was a very important project as it combined all the tasks we have learned in our
first two months of work. This project is a copy of the famous website [Takealot](https://www.takealot.com/). You are able to add each product to your shopping
cart, allocate the amount of each item, add shipping, and use a discount code at the last checkout page!
